# Cornpunch

Cornpunch is a Facepunch powered movie hosting service, it was made for educational purposes. It is powered by my Facepunch wrapper.

#Instructions

This will need PHP 5.0.+ as well as CURL, you will also need PHPMyAdmin combined with MySQL. You will have to set up the databases your self, but its pretty straight forward.

#Current State

I would love to rewrite this because I was testing a ton of ways to do stuff.
